# Deployment Guide

### 1. Build the frontend

```bash
bun run build
```

This runs `vite build` and outputs the React SPA to the `dist/` directory. The Worker serves these static files for all non-API routes.

### 2. Create a D1 database

If you have not yet created a D1 database for this project:

```bash
wrangler d1 create ai-site-starter-db
```

This outputs a `database_id`. Copy it.

### 3. Configure `wrangler.toml`

**File:** `wrangler.toml`

```toml
name = "ai-site-starter"
main = "src/api/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2025-01-13"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[assets]
directory = "./dist"
binding = "ASSETS"
not_found_handling = "single-page-application"
run_worker_first = true

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "ai-site-starter-db"
database_id = "placeholder"
```

Replace `"placeholder"` in `database_id` with the actual UUID from step 2.

#### Configuration breakdown

| Field | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `name` | Worker name (appears in Cloudflare dashboard) |
| `main` | Worker entry point (the Hono API server) |
| `compatibility_date` | Cloudflare Workers runtime compatibility target |
| `compatibility_flags` | `nodejs_compat` enables Node.js APIs in Workers |
| `[assets].directory` | Path to the built frontend files |
| `[assets].binding` | Binding name for the asset fetcher (`env.ASSETS`) |
| `[assets].not_found_handling` | `single-page-application` returns `index.html` for unmatched routes (SPA client-side routing) |
| `[assets].run_worker_first` | `true` means the Worker handles all requests first; unmatched non-API routes fall through to static assets |
| `[[d1_databases]].binding` | The binding name for the D1 database (`env.DB`) |
| `[[d1_databases]].database_name` | Human-readable name of the D1 database |
| `[[d1_databases]].database_id` | UUID of the D1 database in your Cloudflare account |

### 4. Set production secrets

Production secrets are stored securely in Cloudflare and are **not** committed to source control.

```bash
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
```

When prompted, enter a strong random secret string (at least 32 characters). This is used to sign auth tokens.

```bash
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_URL
```

Enter your production URL (e.g. `https://your-app.your-domain.com` or `https://ai-site-starter.your-subdomain.workers.dev`).

Optionally, if you have additional trusted origins (e.g. for CORS):

```bash
wrangler secret put TRUSTED_ORIGINS
```

Enter a comma-separated list of origins (e.g. `https://other-domain.com,https://staging.example.com`).

### 5. Apply database migrations to production

```bash
bun run db:migrate:remote
```

This runs `wrangler d1 migrations apply ai-site-starter-db --remote` and applies all pending migration files from the `migrations/` directory to the production D1 database.

### 6. Deploy

```bash
bun run deploy
```

This runs `wrangler deploy`, which:

1. Bundles the Worker entry point (`src/api/index.ts`) and its dependencies
2. Uploads the built static assets from `dist/`
3. Deploys to Cloudflare's edge network

After deployment, your app is live at `https://ai-site-starter.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
