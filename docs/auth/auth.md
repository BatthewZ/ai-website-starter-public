# Authentication

## Overview

Authentication is handled by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), a TypeScript-first auth library. The project uses email/password authentication with sessions stored in the D1 database. Auth is split across three layers:

1. **Backend**: Better Auth factory, session middleware, auth routes, and auth guard middleware.
2. **Frontend**: Better Auth React client, route guard components, and shared validation schemas.
3. **Shared**: Zod schemas used for both frontend form validation and backend request validation.
