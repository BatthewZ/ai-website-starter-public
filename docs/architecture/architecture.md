# Architecture

## Overview

ai-site-starter is a full-stack application served from a **single Cloudflare Worker**. The Worker runs a Hono API for backend logic and serves a React single-page application (SPA) for the frontend. Both are deployed as one unit -- there is no separate API server or static hosting service.

The stack:

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers
- **API framework**: Hono
- **Frontend**: React 19 + React Router + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) via Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Better Auth (email/password)
- **Validation**: Zod (shared between frontend and backend)
- **Package manager**: Bun
