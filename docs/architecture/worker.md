# Worker Architecture

## Single Worker Architecture

The entire application -- API routes, auth logic, and the React SPA -- is served from one Cloudflare Worker. The Worker entry point is `src/api/index.ts`, which creates a Hono app.

The routing strategy splits traffic into two categories:

1. **`/api/*` requests** are handled by the Hono application (API routes, middleware, auth).
2. **All other requests** are forwarded to the Cloudflare Assets binding, which serves the pre-built Vite output (the React SPA).

This is implemented at the bottom of `src/api/index.ts`:

```ts
// API routes
app.route("/api", routes);

// Catch-all for unknown API paths
app.all("/api/*", (c) => {
  const requestId = c.get("requestId") ?? "unknown";
  return c.json({ error: "Not Found", requestId }, 404);
});

// Everything else -> serve the SPA
app.all("*", (c) => c.env.ASSETS.fetch(c.req.raw));
```

## How `run_worker_first` Works

The `wrangler.toml` configuration controls how the Worker and static assets interact:

```toml
[assets]
directory = "./dist"
binding = "ASSETS"
not_found_handling = "single-page-application"
run_worker_first = true
```

### What `run_worker_first = true` does

By default, Cloudflare Workers with an assets binding check the static assets directory first. If a file matches the request path (e.g., `/assets/index-abc123.js`), it is served directly without invoking the Worker. The Worker only runs for paths that do not match a static file.

Setting `run_worker_first = true` reverses this: **the Worker always runs first** for every request. The Worker then decides whether to handle the request itself or forward it to the assets binding via `c.env.ASSETS.fetch(c.req.raw)`.

This is necessary because:

1. The Worker needs to apply middleware (request ID, logging, security headers, CORS, session extraction) to all `/api/*` requests before routing.
2. The Worker's catch-all `app.all("*", ...)` explicitly delegates non-API requests to the assets binding.

### What `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"` does

When the assets binding receives a request for a path that does not correspond to a real file (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/settings`), instead of returning a 404, it serves `index.html`. This enables client-side routing -- React Router handles these paths in the browser.
